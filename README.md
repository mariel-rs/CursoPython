# First mission

Here are the exercises ("katas") for the first mission of the LaunchX program. 

## Contents

This repository is structured in folders for each topic discussed in the program. Katas are uploaded mostly as Jupyter notebooks following the Modulo{number}Katas.ipynb convention, where `{number}` represents the course module number. For instance, Modulo9Katas.ipynb is the "kata" (exercise set) for the Module 9.
